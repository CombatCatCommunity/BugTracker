## **Before Submitting A Report**

- Before submitting a new report, it is recommended that you search existing Issues to see if a report similar to yours has already been made. You can do this by using the **search bar** on the Issues page.

- If you find an existing Issue that is similar to what you wanted to report, you should just "**Thumbs Up**" that instead of creating a duplicate report.

- You can "**Thumbs Up**" by clicking on the Emoji Icon on the top right corner of any comment.
