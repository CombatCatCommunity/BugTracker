## **Before Submitting A Report**

- Before submitting a new report, it is recommended that you search existing Issues to see if a report similar to yours has already been made. You can do this by using the **search bar** on the Issues page.

- If you find an existing Issue that is similar to what you wanted to report, you should just "**Thumbs Up**" that instead of creating a duplicate report.

- You can "**Thumbs Up**" by clicking on the Emoji Icon on the bottom left corner of any comment.

- Additionally, you can add more information to existing Issues by commenting on those threads to help resolve them faster.

## **Closing A Report**

- Your report may be closed if a Combat Cat Studio member has attended to it or marked it as resolved.
- You can close your own reports too if you have made a mistake in your submission or if the bug has now been fixed. You can find the "Close issue" button at the bottom of the page on your Issue.
